## Running the code
I recommend you use [Deno](https://deno.com/) to run this project, a zero-config modern JavaScript runtime with native TypeScript support. To install it:

- On windows, run ```irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex```
- On MacOS or Linux, run ```curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh```

Now, to run the code, simply run
```
deno run main.ts
```

To run the tests, run
```
deno test
```
